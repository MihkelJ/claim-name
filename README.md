# Claim Name üéâ

This Web3 application enables communities to grant ENS subdomains to members they follow, streamlining identity and membership management

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Getting an ENS Domain** üåê
   - Visit [ens.domains](https://ens.domains/) and connect your Web3 wallet
   - Search for an available .eth domain name
   - Register the domain
2. **Community Setup** üë•
   - The community owner connects their wallet containing an ENS domain
   - They set up text records for avatar and heading to customize community appearance:
     - `avatar=https://example.com/community-avatar.png`
     - `header=https://example.com/community-banner.gif`
3. **Member Management** üë§
   - Community owners use EFP (Ethereum Follow Protocol) to follow members
   - EFP following status determines subname claim eligibility
   - When `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEMBERS_ONLY` is set to true, only followed members can claim subdomains
4. **Claiming Process** üè∑Ô∏è
   - Members connect their Web3 wallet
   - If `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEMBERS_ONLY` is enabled, only members who hold an EFP follow token from the community can choose their desired subname
   - The system checks availability and validates the chosen name
   - Upon confirmation, the subname is minted to the member's address
